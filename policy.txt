Privacy Policy:

Last Updated: 12/16/2024

Data Collection & Usage:
This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information about its users. It does not track browsing history, record clicked links, or share user data with third parties. The only data stored locally in Chrome’s sync storage are user preferences (e.g., whether certain search modes are enabled), which remain fully under the user’s control.

Highlighted Text & Searches:
When you highlight text and trigger a search, the selected text is sent directly to the chosen search engine (Google or your browser’s default search engine). This is functionally equivalent to entering a query into a search bar. The extension does not record these queries; it simply passes them on to initiate the search.

Third-Party Services:
The extension does not integrate with third-party analytics or advertising platforms. It does not track user behavior, gather identifiable information, or send data to external servers beyond what is required to perform a normal web search.

Changes to the Privacy Policy:
If this privacy policy changes, we will update it here. We recommend reviewing this policy periodically.
